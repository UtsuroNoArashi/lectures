- Importance of the concept
- Concept of information
- Reference to Shannon
- Overall analisys of Shannon's paper `A mathematical theory of comunication`.
    Specifically, the parts regarding the entropy, it's derivation and properties.
- Concept of self-information
- Axiomatic definition of entropy and proof of the

- Concepts of UDC and IDC 
- Sardinas-Patterson algorithm
- Concept of prefix codes

# PDF 2 - Kraft inequality
- The inequality itself and it's meaning 
- Proof of the fact that if a code is a IC, then the inequality is satisfied,
    the viceversa does not hold.
- From above, the conclusion that the inequality is a requirement for IC.

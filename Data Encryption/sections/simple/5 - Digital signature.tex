    Consider the following: an entity \(A\) produce some message and it wants 
        to make sure that, if asked to, \(A\) can be prove that such message was 
        indeed produced by it; how can this be done?
        In other words, how can we guarantee that a message was produced by \(A\) and not some 
        other entity \(B\)? A simple solution is that of signing the message, that is,
        let \(A\) compute some value \(x\) such that no other entity besides it 
        can compute it correctly.

    In some cases is enough to sign a compressed version of the document, e.g. 
        it's hash value. 

    In the following we show how to sign a document, assumed as an integer \(m\),
        by means of ElGamal and RSA.

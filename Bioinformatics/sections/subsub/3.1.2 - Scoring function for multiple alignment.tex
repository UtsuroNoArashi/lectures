    Among all possible scoring functions, the ones we care about are:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item the \emph{sum of pairs}, 
            \item the \emph{entropy}, and 
            \item the \emph{multiple lsc}.
        \end{enumerate}

    We briefly overview each one. Let \(v_{i}, v_{j}\) be two sequences in the 
        multiple alignment, for each pair of \(i, j\) we compute \(s^{*}(v_{i}, v_{j})\);
        hence, the overall score \(s(v_{1}, \ldots, v_{n})\) is given by 
        \[
            s(v_{1}, \ldots, v_{n}) = \sum_{i \ne j} s^{*}(v_{i}, v_{j})
        \]

    One can also extend the computation of the score to the single column, and subsequentially 
        sum these values.

    In the case of entropy, we make use of Shannon's entropy (see \cite{shannon1948}
        for all the details). Essentially we compute the probability of each nucleotide/acid 
        in each column, then we compute the entropy of each column, lastly we proceed to sum 
        all the computed entropies.

    As for the multiple lsc, given \(k\) sequences we count as match a column in which
        all symbols coincide, that is, the same nucleotide/acid appear in each sequence 
        in that column. The overall multiple lsc is the number of mathes. 
        Note that, by the way it's defined, this score is useful in the case of very similar 
        sequences.

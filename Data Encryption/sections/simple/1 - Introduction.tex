    Data encryption dials with how informations, see \cite{shannon1948} for the definition, 
        can be transmited securely through a channel.
        
    More in details, if \(m\) is a message we want to send through a channel,
        first we have to encode it in a form that allows it to be transmited; 
        then we want that such message is meaningless to those 
        who have no right to read it. On the other hand, we want to be able to 
        retrieve the message once this is recived.

    To achive the above two disciplines were found: Cryptography and Code theory;
        the former focuses on how to make data secure, the latter provides 
        methods to transmit data through a channel.

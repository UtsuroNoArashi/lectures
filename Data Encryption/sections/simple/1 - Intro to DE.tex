    Data encryption and codes focuses on two aspects of cybersecurity,
        that are cryptography and linear codes. 
        For this reason, the present notes will be structured as follow: 
        in \emph{Sections \ref{Sec:2}-\ref{Sec:4}} we discuss some algorithms 
        used in cryptography, mainly focusing on public key encryption and hyperelliptic curves 
        based algorithms; from \emph{Section \ref{Sec:5}} onwards we focus on linear codes.

    The remainder of this section will provide the reader some notions of abstract algebra,
        central to many of the topics described in the following sections.

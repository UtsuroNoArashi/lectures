    We as humans are subject to biases, which are systematic pattern deviation 
        from the norm or rationality in the mental process of judgement.
        As for fallacies, we can distinguish several forms of bias; 
        and interestringly enough biases are at the base of some of the fallacies we discussed previously.

    As done for fallacies, we list some of the most common types of biases, 
        to give the reader an idea of what these are concretely.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \underline{Confirmation bias}: is a mental process that consists in selecting
            the information possessed in order to place greater attention,
            and therefore greater credibility, on those that confirm oneâ€™s
            beliefs.

        \item \underline{Belief bias}: is the tendency to judge the correctness of an
            argument based on the correctness of the conclusion.

        \item \underline{Availability bias} (studied by Kahneman\footnotemark and Tversky) is the
            tendency that leads us to make judgments on the basis of the
            most available examples and/or information, which most easily
            and vividly come to mind.
    \end{itemize}

    \footnotetext{For their result, Kahneman was praised with the nobel (Tversky was dead at that time).
    On the topic of biases, we suggest reading ``Thinking, Fast and Slow'' by Kahneman.}

    In the remainder of this section we recall some notions of abstract algebra 
        needed later in the document; we begin by defining what divisibility, 
        \gls{gcd} and \gls{lcm} are in \(\Z\), then describing what congruence modulo \(n\) is,
        we continue with defining groups and rings and conclude with an overview on field extension.

    In this section we provide the reader with some notions of abstract algebra;
        we recall what \gls{gcd} and \gls{lcm} are, we discuss congruence modulo \(n\),
        and present groups and rings, and discuss some well know results on them. 

    Also, some broad concepts of projective geometry will be given; 
        we focus on what projective space is, what the sum of projective points looks like, 
        and to conclude, we give consider elliptic curves.

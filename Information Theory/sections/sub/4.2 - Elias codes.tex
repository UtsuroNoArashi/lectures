    When referring to the Elias code, we generally mean two codes: the 
    \emph{gamma} code and the \emph{delta} code, both proposed by 
    \emph{Peter Elias} in \cite{elias1975}.

    Before introducing the codes, it is useful to define some notation. 
    Let \(x\) be an integer, and let \(B(x)\) denote its binary representation. 
    We define \(\abs{B(x)}\) as the number of bits required to represent \(x\).

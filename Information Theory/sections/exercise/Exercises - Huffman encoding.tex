        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Given the following strings, compute both the standard and the 
                canonical Huffman encodings, and compare the results in terms of code length.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \(\omega_{0} = abbaca\)
                    \item \(\omega_{1} = cabbab\)
                \end{itemize}

            \item Decode the following strings assuming they have been encoded 
                with standard Huffman coding, and the alphabet is \(\Sigma = \{a, b, c\}\). 
                Also reconstruct the Huffman tree for each string.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \(s_{0} = 1010110\), with symbol frequencies inferred from the string
                    \item \(s_{1} = 1100101\), with symbol frequencies inferred from the string
                \end{itemize}

            \item Compute the adaptive Huffman encoding for the following strings,
                updating the tree after each symbol. 
                Compare the final code length with the standard Huffman encoding.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \(\omega_{0} = abacb\)
                    \item \(\omega_{1} = bbaca\)
                \end{itemize}

            \item Decode the following strings assuming adaptive Huffman coding was used,
                and reconstruct the tree step by step.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \(s_{0} = 0110101\), with initial alphabet \(\Sigma = \{a, b, c\}\)
                    \item \(s_{1} = 1101010\), with initial alphabet \(\Sigma = \{a, b, c\}\)
                \end{itemize}

            \item Decode the following canonical Huffman encoded strings,
                given the symbol lengths for each alphabet. 
                Ensure that the decoded text matches the original string.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \(s_{0} = 000110101\), with symbol lengths \(\{a:2, b:3, c:3\}\)
                    \item \(s_{1} = 0110010\), with symbol lengths \(\{a:2, b:3, c:3\}\)
                \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}

    The RSA algorithm, from the name of its inventors: Rivest, Shamir and Adleman 
        (see \cite{adlemanRS1977} for major details); is a public-key algorithm based on
        the hard problem of integers factorization.

    Formally speaking, the \gls{ifp} is defined as follow: given a positive integer \(n\),
        find its prime factors; that is, find \(p_{1},p_{2}, \ldots, p_{k}\) such that
        \(n = p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} p_{2}^{\alpha_{2}}\cdots p_{k}^{\alpha_{k}}\), with \(\alpha_{i} \ge 1\).

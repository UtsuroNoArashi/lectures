    So far, we have discussed several compression techniques under the assumption
    that the input to such compressors is ``optimal''\footnotemark. However, what
    if this is not the case? Can we preprocess the string in such a way that, once
    it reaches the compressor, it becomes optimal? The answer is affirmative, and
    this section introduces one of such optimizations.

    \footnotetext{In this context, ``optimal'' refers to a string with the
    lowest possible entropy.}

    We are interested into serching for similarities within genes;
        that is, given two sequences of DNA or proteins, we want to find subsequences 
        that are common to both. There are essentially two approches we can take:
        alignment and alignment-free based algorithms. The remainder of this section
        covers the former, in addition to some notions needed to work with such algorithms.

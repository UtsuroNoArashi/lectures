    So far, we've discussed of a few compression techniques 
        assuming that the input of such compressors was ``optimal''\footnotemark[2].
        But what if, this was not the case? 
        Can we preprocess the string in such a way that,
            once it reaches the compressor, this is optimal?
        The answer is yes and this section introduced a few of such optimization.

    \footnotetext[2]{In this context by ``optimal'', 
        we mean that the string has the lowest possible entropy.}

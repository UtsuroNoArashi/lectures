    Let's now focus our attention onto the source itself.
    In general, the alphabet these use may not be suitable for transmission,
        for some reason or another.
    For this particular reason, a \emph{encoder} is used to convert the source alphabet,
        to a new one, which is more suitable for transmission.
    On the recieving side, a \emph{decoder} is used to convert back to the original alphabet.
    This process is called \emph{source encoding/decoding}.

    Formally, given a source \(S\) defined on some alphabet, 
        and \(X\) a new alphabet, called \emph{input alphabet}, 
        we define a function \(C : S \to X\) that maps sequences of symbols of \(S\)
        to sequences of symbols in \(X\). 
        A sequence of symbols in \(X\) is called a \emph{codeword}.

    Before we consider specific types of \emph{codes},
        let us consider the general case. 
    Let's \(C\) be a generic mapping from a source \(S\) to some new alphabet \(X\).
    Since we have not imposed any condition on \(C\), 
        one may define it in such a way that two, or more,
        source symbols share the same codeword.
    It easy to observe that, in doing so,
        the decoded message may not be correct or even unique.

    \begin{example*}
        Let's consider the code shown below.
        \subfile{../../extra/TikZ/Example - Non non-singular codes.tex}
        How would we decode the text 000111? 
            We have two possibilities: 
                either as \(s_{1}s_{1}s_{3}s_{2}\) or as \(s_{1}s_{1}s_{3}s_{4}\).
        As said before, the decoded message might not be unique. 
        Also, unless the context is given, there's no way to know which one is correct.
    \end{example*}

    From the above example, we can conclude that a ``good'' code must encode each 
    source symbols with a unique codeword. 
    We call such codes \emph{non-singular codes}.

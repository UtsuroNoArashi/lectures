    Deconding a text compressed via the \gls{ac} encoding,
        is straightforward as its encoding.
        In fact, the decoding proceeds similarly to the encoding.
        We just 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Initialize the range \([0, 1]\).
            \item We divide the subrange according to the probabilities,
                as done for the encoding.
            \item At each step we select as current interval the one where the 
                encoded text fall in to.
        \end{enumerate}
        Algorithmically speaking we proceed applying the procedure in \emph{Figure \ref{Fig:5}}.

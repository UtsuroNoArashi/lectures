    After Diffie and Hellman published their paper, apart from the RSA protocol,
        a new scheme was proposed: the ElGamal protocol. Formally speaking,
        the algorithm is based on the \gls{dlp}: fixed a group \(\gf{p}\) 
        and two non-zero elements \(g \text{ and } h\), find \(x\) such that 
        \[
            g^{x} \equiv h \mod{p}.
        \]

    We discuss the algorithm as follow: first we describe the algorithm in the 
        case of integers modulo a prime, then we discuss it in the context of elliptic curves.

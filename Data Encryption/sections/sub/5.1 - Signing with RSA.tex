    Assume that \(A\) has already computed its public key \((e, n)\) and the private key \(d\). 
        These, of course, must satisfy \(1 = ed + \lambda \mu\).

    To sign the document \(A\) has to:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Compute the hash of its message \(m\), call it \(h = H(m)\), 
            with \(H\) some hash function.
        \item Sign \(h\) by computing \(f = h^{d} \mod{n}\).
        \item Source the signed document (i.e. \(f\)) to a TTP.
    \end{enumerate}

    Let us consider the case in which one wants to check whether \(A\) produced \(h\).
        Such entity has to compute \(f^{e} = (h^{d})^{e} \mod{n} = h\).
        Hance, proving that \(A\) indeed produced \(h\), and therefore \(m\).
        It's somewhat obvious that if someone tries to falsy claim the ownership of \(m\),
        once asked to compute \(h\) this will fail.

    Consider any linear code \(\mathcal{C}\). How do we represent it?
        Since we are considering vector subspaces, two good solutions are given 
        by linear algebra. In fact, we can represent \(\mathcal{C}\) 
        either by means of parametric equations or as set of solutions to 
        a given set of Cartesian equations.

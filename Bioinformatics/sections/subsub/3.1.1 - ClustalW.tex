    Introduced in \cite{thompson1994} by Thompson et al., is a three step process 
        that computes the best alignment. Let \(n\) be the number of sequences to 
        align, the algorithm proceeds to compute all \(\binom{n}{2}\) pair-wise 
        alignment. From the latters, it defines a similarity matrix by some 
        scoring function, (we discuss these in the next section). 
        From the similarity matrix, by some tree-building procedure (eg. neighbor join, 
        see \emph{Section \ref{Sec:Nj}}) construct a guide tree; us this to define the alignment.

    One of the most important problems in biology is that of similarity; 
        that is, given two strings encoding either DNA or proteins sequences,
        find the best alignment to make them look similar.
        We explain the concept of similarity in the next section.
    
    There are essentially two approches to solve the problem, either via 
        alignment based algorithms or via alignment-free algorithms.
        The former will be covered in the present section, 
        in which we focus on pair-wise alignment, i.e., alignment of two strings;
        and in the one following, in which we discuss multiple alignment.
        We cover alignment-free algorithms in \emph{Section \ref{Sec:4}}.

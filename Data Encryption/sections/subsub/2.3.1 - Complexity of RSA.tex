    It's easy to see that as for ElGamal, the complexity of RSA is \bigO{n^{3}} for A and B,
        and \bigO{e^{n}n^{2}} for E. In fact, if we consider B and A, 
        their most expensive computation regards the cyphering/decyphering of \(c\);
        while E has to factorize \(n\) to get \(p\) and/or \(q\), 
        requiring \bigO{e^{n}n^{2}} computations by brute force.

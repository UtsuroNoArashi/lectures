    Consider the following: assume a new protein was just discovered;
        hence, we would like to know which other known protein shares same 
        similarities with it. To complete such task, we have to run a similarity 
        test with all the proteins stored in a biological database, 
        (we discuss databases in some later section).
    
    Observe that the use of SW or NW algorithms is not feasible. 
        In fact, we would have to run a \bigO{n^{2}} algorithm for each sequences in the database.
        Since these store thousands or hundred of thousands of sequences, 
        such algorithms are clearly not suitable for the task. 
        In this context the use of heuristic algorithms is preferred.
        We recall that a heuristic algorithm does not garantee the correct/best 
        solution, but they provide a good trade-off between efficiency and correctness.

    In this section we focus on pair-wise alignment by means of heuristic algorithms;
        we discuss FASTA and BLAST.

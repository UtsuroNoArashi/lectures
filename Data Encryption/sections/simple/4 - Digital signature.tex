    In todays era of digital documents, it is fundamental to have a way 
        to garantee the ownership of a file, a program or whatsoever.
        Is in this context that digital signature found its use.
        
    In what follows, we will denote by \(\mathcal{S}\) the signature of the document and 
        by \(\mathcal{V}\) the trusted entity that proceed to verify the signature;
        addionally, what we consider is not the document in itself, rather its hash.

    \subsection{RSA digital signature}
    \subfile{../sub/4.1 - RSA signature}

    \subsection{ElGamal digital signature}
    \subfile{../sub/4.2 - ElGamal signature}

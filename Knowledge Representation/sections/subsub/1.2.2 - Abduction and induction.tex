    For what we have said about deduction, is easy to understand
        that it with logical inferences that are certain.
        Abduction and induction on the other hand cover probable inferences.
        That is, deduction differs from both, abduction and induction,
        by the degree of trust we put in the inference.
        To see such differece, see how the sentence 

        \begin{quote*}
            If it rains, we always take the umbrella. Yesterday we took the umbrella,
            so yesterday it rained.
        \end{quote*}

        \noindent becomes the sentence 

        \begin{quote*}
             If it rains, we always take the umbrella. Yesterday we took the umbrella,
             so yesterday it probably rained.
        \end{quote*}

        \noindent in the abduction case, and 

        \begin{quote*}
             If it rains, we always take the umbrella. Tomorrow it will rain,
             so probably tomorrow we will take the umbrella.
        \end{quote*}

        \noindent in the induction one.

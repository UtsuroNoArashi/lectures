    Modern days cryptography is based on a set of protocols based on the concept of 
        \emph{public-key} exchange. We proceed as follow: the idea of public-key 
        cryptography is defined first, then some protocols will be presented.
        For the latter we discuss both the algorithms and the mathematical hard problem 
        these are based on.

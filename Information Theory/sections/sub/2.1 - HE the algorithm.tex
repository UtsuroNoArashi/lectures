    We consider the binary case; the extension to the general case is straightforward.
    Let 
    \[
        S = \begin{pmatrix}
            s_{1} & s_{2} & \cdots & s_{n} \\ 
            p_{1} & p_{2} & \cdots & p_{n} 
        \end{pmatrix}
    \]
    denote a source with probabilities arranged in non-increasing order.
    Define \(R(S)\) as the \emph{reduced source}, 
        obtained by replacing the two least probable symbols in \(S\)
        with a single symbol whose probability is the sum of the merged symbols:
        \[
            R(S) = \begin{pmatrix}
                s_{1} & s_{2} & \cdots & (s_{n - 1}, s_{n}) \\ 
                p_{1} & p_{2} & \cdots & p_{n - 1} + p_{n} \\
            \end{pmatrix}
        \]
    Let \(C_{R}\) denote a binary prefix code for \(R(S)\), 
        and let \(z\) be the codeword assigned to the merged symbol \((s_{n - 1}, s_{n})\).
    A prefix code \(C\) for \(S\) can then be obtained from \(C_{R}\) by assigning 
        the \(i\)-th symbol of \(S\) the \(i\)-th codeword in \(C_{R}\) for \(i \le n - 2\). 
        The codewords for \(s_{n - 1}\) and \(s_{n}\) are \(z0\) and \(z1\), respectively.

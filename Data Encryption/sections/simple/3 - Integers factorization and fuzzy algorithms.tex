    From what discussed in \emph{Section \ref{Sec:2}}, it's easy to understand that 
        integer factorization is a difficult task; additionally, many of the algorithms
        that allows us to actually factorize integer make an extensive use of Euclidean algorithm.
        
    This section will focus on presenting an enhanced Euclidean algorithm, the so called 
        \emph{extended Euclidean algorithm}, and some algorithms for integers factorization.

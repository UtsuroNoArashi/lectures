    When we talk about bioinformatics, we refer to some sort of bridge between 
        life sciences and informatics. The reason this kind of relationship is needed 
        is due to the fact that biology, with \gls{dna} sequencing, etc, is a source of big data;
        additionally, biology can benefit from informatics to ease some of its tasks, i.e.,
        protein sequencing. In this notes we focus on various algorithms to menage both DNA 
        and protein sequencing. Before doing so, in the remainder of this section we provide to
        the reader some notions of molecular biology; that is, we overview what aminoacids are,
        how these are related to proteins, the structure of DNA and RNAs and how these leadto proteins synthetisis.

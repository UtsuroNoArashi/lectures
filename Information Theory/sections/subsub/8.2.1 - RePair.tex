    Re-Pair introduced in \cite{larsson2000} by arsson and Moffat, 
        is a very simple algorithm that attempts to solve the SGP.

    The algorithm proceeds recursively to looks for the digram with the highest 
        frequency in the string and replaces it with a new non-terminal symbol. 
        We stop once no substitution can be done, i.e., all digrams have frequency 1.

    One can reach a correct reasoning through three approches: 
        \emph{deduction}, \emph{abduction} and \emph{induction}. 
        We discuss each of these in the next few sections, 
        but we focus maily on deduction in the rest of these notes.

    We note that, in the case of formal reasoning, 
        frequent mistakes usually concernes conditional statements, i.e., 
        sentences of the form ``If A, then B`` or those that can somehow be transformed into one of this type.
        We call A and B, respectively, \emph{antecedent} and \emph{consequent}.
